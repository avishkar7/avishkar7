### Hi there, I'm Avishkar 👋  
### AND YES — MY NAME DOES MEAN ✨INVENTION✨

🎓 **M.S. Electrical Engineering @ UC Irvine (UCI)**  
📡 Passionate about **Wireless Communications / Systems** and **Edge AI**

---

## 👨‍💻 What I’m working on
- **Split Computing / Collaborative Inference** for wireless systems  
  (deciding *what* runs on-device vs *what* runs on the edge/cloud under latency, bandwidth, and energy constraints)
- Exploring **Edge AI + ML optimization** for real-time deployment in communication-constrained environments

---

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
- **Machine Learning / Deep Learning projects**
- **Neural Networks** (vision, time-series, embedded ML, optimization)
- **Wireless + ML** intersections: edge inference, scheduling, resource allocation, latency-aware ML systems

If you’re building something in **ML + systems**, or need a collaborator who enjoys connecting **theory ↔ implementation**, I’m in.

---

## 🧠 Interests
- Edge AI / On-device ML  
- Wireless networking (5G/6G-style thinking, RAN, resource constraints)  
- Optimization-driven ML systems  
- Deployable ML pipelines (latency + throughput + energy tradeoffs)
